usage: main.py [-h] [-d] [-s] [-r] [-p] [--username USERNAME]

Getting Started
----------------
usage: main.py args

optional arguments:
-h, --help
-d, --daemon
-s, --stop-daemon
-r, --restart-daemon
-p, --pull

Linux
-----------
Google-Docs-Sync will create a local folder called "Google Docs" in your ~/ directory. In linux that would be home/[username], and in OS X that would be User/[username]. In Windows, I *believe* that is your My Documents folder. However, this will fail when being run under OS X or Windows. Neither of those platforms have the requisite inotify service. Inotify provides filesystem monitoring so that the sync can detect when a local file has been changed and then send those changes to Google docs.

Windows
----------------
I believe it will completely fail because Windows doesn't support the daemon module.

OS X
-----
It might properly download all the docs, but when it tries to setup the bits to watch the local filesystem, it will fail.


I would like support for those platforms. If you have the know how to accomplish this outside of Linux, please let me know!
=======
Manually or automatically sync your Google Docs. Currently it's a one way sync. 
If you make changes locally while in daemon mode (-d), they will show up remotely,
but remote changes aren't pulled down until the daemon is restarted.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --daemon          Start the sync in daemon mode (ignores all other
                        options)
  -s, --stop-daemon     Stop the running daemon (ignores all other options)
  -r, --restart-daemon  Restart the running daemon (ignores all other options)
  -p, --pull            Download all documents from the server one time
  --username USERNAME   Set the username
  --password PASSWORD   Set the password
